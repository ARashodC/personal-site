    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>Let's play some game together! I play quite frequently mostly on pc, but i also own a switch. 
      I have an enitre streaming setup and sometimes even stream on switch! 
      I play games from Destiny 2, to The Crew, to Pokemon. 
      I am open to all and every game, so invite whenever your up for some gaming fun! 
      Playing games is a big passion and part of my personality so I'm also excited to play just about anything, new or old!</p>

    <h2>Art</h2>  
    <p>On my off time, I do dabble in some art, from pencel drawing to computer design/art. 
      I'm not very good anymore sense I'm not very consistent, but I still love to work on my art and even get asked to do digital art from friends and family!</p>
